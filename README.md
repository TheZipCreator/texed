# Texed
**Texed** (pronounced like 'text', /tÎµkst/) is a text animation engine with a WYSIWYG graphical user interface. It is primarily based off of my previous work on [Texit](https://github.com/thezipcreator/texit), but it is an entirely new engine.

Migrated to [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~thezipcreator/Texed)

**NOTE:** Texed is currently in a very early state, and as such, is lacking in many Quality of Life features and most likely still contains many bugs. Use at your own discretion.
